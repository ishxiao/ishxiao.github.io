# 1 Languages

English is a prerequisite. If you haven’t mastered it yet, learn it. You must be able to read, write, speak and understand English, but you don’t have to be perfect here. The lousy English used in this text is mine. That’s enough. All publications are in English. Note the importance of being able to write in English. Sooner or later you will wish to publish your results. People must be able to read and understand your stuff.

French, German, Spanish and Italian may be useful too, but they are not at all necessary. They are nowhere near the foundations of our sky-scraper, so don’t worry. You do need the Greek alphabet. Greek letters are used a lot. Learn their names, otherwise you make a fool of yourself when giving an oral presentation.

If you have managed to read and follow this webpage so far, you probably don't need a first course in English. However, you want to be precise in your academic publications. You never want to be misunderstood, after all. Below, you will find several resources that are intended to be helpful for readers of various levels and with various requirements.

# 2 Primary Mathematics

Now, first things first. Are you comfortable with numbers, adding, subtracting, square roots, etc.?

- Natural numbers: 1, 2, 3, …
- Integers: …, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, …
- Rational numbers (fractions): 
\\(\frac{1}{2}\\),
\\(\frac{1}{4}\\),
\\(\frac{3}{4}\\),
\\(\frac{23791}{773}\\), ...

- Real numbers: \\(\sqrt{2} = 1.4142135\cdots\\) , \\(\pi = 3.14159265\cdots\\) ,\\(e = 2.7182818\cdots\\), ...

- Complex numbers: 2+3i, \\(e^{ia}= \cos(a) + i \sin(a)\\), ... they are very important!
Set theory: open sets, compact spaces. Topology.You may be surprised to learn that they do play a role indeed in physics!

- Algebraic equations. Approximation techniques. Series expansions: the Taylor series. 
- Solving equations with complex numbers. Trigonometry: \\(\sin(2x)=2\sin x \cos x\\), etc.
- Infinitesimals. Differentiation. Differentiate basic functions (sin, cos, exp). 
- Integration. Integrate basic functions, when possible. Differential equations. Linear equations.
- The Fourier transformation. The use of complex numbers. Convergence of series.
- The complex plane. Cauchy theorems and contour integration (now this is fun).
- The Gamma function (enjoy studying its properties). 
- Gaussian integrals. Probability theory.
- Partial differential equations. Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions.

# 22 Supersymmetry and Supergravity

In theoretical physics, supergravity (supergravity theory; SUGRA for short) is a field theory that combines the principles of supersymmetry and general relativity. In supergravity, supersymmetry is local (in contrast to non-gravitational supersymmetric theories, such as the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model). Since the generators of supersymmetry (SUSY) are convoluted with the Poincaré group to form a super-Poincaré algebra, it can be seen that gravity follows naturally from local supersymmetry.

# 23 Astro Particle Physics

Astrophysics is the branch of astronomy that employs the principles of physics and chemistry "to ascertain the nature of the heavenly bodies, rather than their positions or motions in space." Among the objects studied are the Sun, other stars, galaxies, extrasolar planets, the interstellar medium and the cosmic microwave background. Their emissions are examined across all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, and the properties examined include luminosity, density, temperature, and chemical composition. Because astrophysics is a very broad subject, astrophysicists typically apply many disciplines of physics, including mechanics, electromagnetism, statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, relativity, nuclear and particle physics, and atomic and molecular physics.

In practice, modern astronomical research often involves a substantial amount of work in the realms of theoretical and observational physics. Some areas of study for astrophysicists include their attempts to determine: the properties of dark matter, dark energy, and black holes; whether or not time travel is possible, wormholes can form, or the multiverse exists; and the origin and ultimate fate of the universe. Topics also studied by theoretical astrophysicists include: Solar System formation and evolution; stellar dynamics and evolution; galaxy formation and evolution; magnetohydrodynamics; large-scale structure of matter in the universe; origin of cosmic rays; general relativity and physical cosmology, including string cosmology and astroparticle physics.

# 24 Super String Theory

Superstring theory is an attempt to explain all of the particles and fundamental forces of nature in one theory by modeling them as vibrations of tiny supersymmetric strings.

'Superstring theory' is a shorthand for supersymmetric string theory because unlike bosonic string theory, it is the version of string theory that accounts for both fermions and bosons and incorporates supersymmetry to model gravity.

Since the second superstring revolution, the five superstring theories are regarded as different limits of a single theory tentatively called M-theory.
