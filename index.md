### Research topics

- Quantum Information and Computing

    *Quantum information is information that is held in the state of a quantum system. Quantum computing is computing using quantum-mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement. A quantum computer is a device that performs quantum computing. Such a computer is different from binary digital electronic computers based on transistors. Whereas common digital computing requires that the data be encoded into binary digits (bits), each of which is always in one of two definite states (0 or 1), quantum computation uses quantum bits or qubits, which can be in superpositions of states.*

- Computational Physics

    *Computational physics is the study and implementation of numerical analysis to solve problems in physics for which a quantitative theory already exists.*

- Deep Learning

   *Deep learning (also known as deep structured learning or hierarchical learning) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on learning data representations, as opposed to task-specific algorithms. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.*
